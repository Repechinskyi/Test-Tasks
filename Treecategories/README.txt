THE TASK

We have a "tree-category". And in each category there are 0 or some number of documents - some files that we will upload.

Each category can belong to a "parent" category. And it can have 0 or some child categories.

Everything needs to work like this:
the left panel of the screen is a "tree" of categories, displaying all "categories" and "documents",
the right side of the screen - shows information. When you click on the "category" - information about the category. When you click on "document" - information about the document.

For this task - in the "categories" there will be only the "title" field, which we need to show to the end user. And "document" will have "file name", "file size" and "upload date".
